## Linting

Many JavaScript implementations do not warn against questionable coding practices. Yes, that's nice for the site that 
"works best with Internet Explorer" (designed with templates, scripted with snippets copied from forums). But it's a 
nightmare when you actually want to write quality, maintainable code.

That's where JavaScript Lint comes in. With JavaScript Lint, you can check all your JavaScript source code for common 
mistakes without actually running the script or opening the web page.

```bash
# Lints and fixes files
yarn run lint
```

## Build Setup

```bash
# Compiles and minifies for production
yarn run build
```
